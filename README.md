# RecipeApp

This JavaScript code creates a web application that pulls food information from a recipe database API, allowing users to search and view results.

How does it work?

1. The user enters a dish name in the search box and presses the search button or presses the Enter key.

2. The code sends a request to the API using the food name entered by the user and retrieves the food data.

3. From the incoming data, it retrieves the dish name, area (for example, American cuisine), image and ingredients.

4. HTML content is created and the food name, region, image and list of ingredients are added to the result container.

5. When the user clicks on any ingredient, a section showing the recipe becomes visible.

6. Users can press the "View Recipe" button to see the recipe or hide the recipe by pressing the "X" button.

7. Users can perform a new search by pressing the "New Search" button.
